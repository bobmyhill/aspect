New: ASPECT now includes a multicomponent compressible model,
where the parameters of each component and the bulk are computed
self-consistently. The pressure and temperature dependencies of the
material parameters are based on the Murnaghan equation of state,
with a thermal pressure term that is linear with temperature.
